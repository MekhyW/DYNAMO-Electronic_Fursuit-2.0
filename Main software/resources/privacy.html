This Telegram Bot is an integral part of the Dynamo project, designed to assist in control-related tasks. 
I (Felipe Catapano Emrich Melo, known as Mekhy) am committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data is secure.

<b>No data collection</b>
The bot does NOT store any data about users or chats in a non-volatile manner. The only data collected by the bot is the last message sent by the user, which is temporarily stored in memory as cache to facilitate the bot's logic and functionality.

<b>Non-Cloud Operation</b>
The Dynamo Telegram Bot does not run on cloud servers, it only operates on a local edge machine and is intended to be physically close to users. The cache is not stored permanently and is cleared when the system is shut down.

<b>Open Source</b>
The bot is part of the Dynamo project, an open-source initiative aimed at enhancing control systems. The project's codebase is publicly available for review and contribution at github.com/MekhyW/DYNAMO-Electronic_Fursuit-2.0.

<b>Changes to This Privacy Statement</b>
I may update this privacy statement from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on my GitHub repository.
